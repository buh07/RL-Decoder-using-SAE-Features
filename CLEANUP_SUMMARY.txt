          REPOSITORY CLEANUP - February 18, 2026                              ║
          Consolidated Documentation & Organized Code Structure               ║

WHAT WAS DONE


1. CONSOLIDATED DOCUMENTATION
   ✓ Moved 15 phase-specific .md files to docs/
   ✓ Organized into:
     - docs/ (active documentation)
     - docs/archived_reports/ (historical)
   ✓ Created 3 new index/guide documents:
     - PROJECT_STATUS.md (root) - Current status & results
     - MASTER_GUIDE.md (root) - Complete orientation guide
     - Updated DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md with new structure

2. ORGANIZED PYTHON SCRIPTS
   ✓ Moved phase scripts to appropriate folders:
     - phase1_ground_truth.py → phase1/
     - test_phase3_validation.py → phase3/
   ✓ Phase 5.4 implementations already in phase5/
   ✓ Core library remains in src/

3. ORGANIZED LOGS
   ✓ Moved all .log files (4) to sae_logs/
   ✓ Logs now organized by phase in sae_logs/

4. CLEANED ROOT DIRECTORY
   Before: 30+ files (.py, .md, .log mixed)
   After: 6 essential files:
     - README.md (project overview)
     - PROJECT_STATUS.md (current status) ← NEW
     - MASTER_GUIDE.md (orientation) ← NEW
     - TODO.md (active tasks)
     - MASTER_GUIDE.md (complete guide) ← NEW
     - overview.tex (research spec)
     - requirements.txt (dependencies)
     - setup_env.sh (environment setup)
